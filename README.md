# T.H.W.A.P. User Environment

Simply checkout the repository like so:

```$ git clone https://github.com/fuzzy/dot-thwap.git ~/.thwap```

And then we can add a source line to your .bashrc (or .zshrc, .shrc, .kshrc or whatever you like)

```$ echo '. ~/.thwap/init.d/thwap.sh' >> .bashrc```

You may want to create a /backup/${USER} directory as well.
